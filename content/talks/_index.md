# Scientists in schools

Astronomy is a subject that can excite everyone, and I enjoy giving regular talks at schools and at public events. I've given (many) dozens of talks at primary and high schools throughout Australia. Each talk is different, designed specifically for the target audience so it aligns with your institution's teaching curriculum, learning objectives, and long-term goals. The topics of these talks include:

- So, you're going to NASA
- To infinity and beyond!
- What does an astrophysicist do, anyway?
- Pathways into astrophysics from high school
- Gaia: The Billion Star Surveyor
- The stars that should not exist

If you'd like me to give a talk at your school or event, please [contact me](../contact).
